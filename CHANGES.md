# Ableton Metrolink - Changes Made

## Problem Description
The application had a connection with Ableton Link, and while the tempo was being read correctly, the rest of the functionality wasn't working properly. The metronome values were not being displayed correctly in the web browser.

## Changes Made

### Server-side Changes (server.js)

1. **Improved Position Calculation**
   - Updated `calculatePosition()` function to use the quantum value from Ableton Link instead of hardcoding it to 4
   - Added quantum to the returned position object for reference

2. **Enhanced State Management**
   - Updated `getCurrentState()` to explicitly get phase information using `link.getPhase()`
   - Added phase and quantum to the main data object sent to clients
   - Ensured consistent use of transport state throughout the function
   - Added more detailed logging

3. **Improved Event Handling**
   - Enhanced event handlers for tempo, numPeers, and playState changes
   - Added immediate state updates to clients when these events occur
   - Ensured the global transportRunning variable is properly updated

4. **Optimized Update Interval**
   - Restructured the update interval code for better readability
   - Added client counting and periodic logging
   - Maintained the 50Hz update rate for responsiveness

### Client-side Changes (index.html)

1. **Enhanced WebSocket Message Handler**
   - Added handling for the new fields (phase and quantum)
   - Improved update condition to check all relevant fields
   - Added more selective logging to reduce console clutter
   - Enhanced debug panel updates

2. **Improved UI Updates**
   - Updated `updateUI()` to handle quantum and phase information
   - Added dynamic beat indicator handling based on quantum
   - Fixed downbeat detection to correctly identify the first beat in a bar
   - Added a global transport state indicator

3. **Added Phase Visualization**
   - Added CSS variable for beat phase
   - Created phase animation with different styles for downbeats vs. regular beats
   - Added a rotating line indicator to show phase visually

### CSS Changes (styles.css)

1. **Added Phase Animation**
   - Added CSS variables and properties for phase animation
   - Created different styles for downbeat vs. regular beat phase animations
   - Added a rotating line indicator that shows the phase visually

2. **Enhanced Transport State Visualization**
   - Added subtle background animation when transport is running
   - Created specific styles for dark theme

## How to Test

1. Start the server: `node server.js`
2. Open the web interface in a browser: `http://localhost:8765`
3. Connect to Ableton Link using an Ableton Link-enabled application
4. Verify that:
   - Tempo is displayed correctly
   - Beat position is displayed correctly
   - Beat indicators highlight the current beat
   - Phase animation shows the progress within each beat
   - Transport state is properly reflected in the UI

## Technical Details

The main issues were:

1. The server wasn't properly handling the quantum value from Ableton Link, which affected position calculation
2. Phase information wasn't being transmitted to the client
3. The client wasn't properly handling and displaying the beat position and phase

These issues have been fixed by ensuring proper data capture, transmission, and display throughout the application.
